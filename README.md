Hamlet is a framework for automated testing of your PL/SQL code.
It is written on PL/SQL and don't require anything else besides Oracle Database.
Currently it is under construction. Now it has basic functions and can be used for testing functions and procedures, that take arguments and return values of basic scalar types. There is a lot of work ahead: make preparing of tests more simple, write tests for framework itself, add support of complex types, cursors, rowtypes, etc., create user interface (using Oracle APEX of course!), and many, many other pleasant things.
